The Cloud Resume Challenge is a 16-step project that indulges prospective cloud engineers and helps open up the cloud to an eager and inquisitive mind.

According to Forrest Brazael who crafted this challenge, it can be summarised as "a proven way to advance your cloud career"

Here I engage and succesfully complete the first 10 steps of the challenge using Microsoft Azure as my cloud service provider. I will proceed further to complete the remaining 6 steps in a different repository.

## How it was implemented

- Frontend of the resume built with html and minimal javascript
- A backend azure function which is trigerred by the javascript code in the frontend 
- An azure Cosmosdb which stores and increments a count value which is fedback to the frontend

Here is a diagram illustrating the functional process of this project:
